<B>CEPHES NUMERICAL LIBRARY</B><p>

The source files in this package were obtained from the CEPHES numerical 
library, prepared by Moshier. The library is available at www.netlib.org.
Only selected files were downloaded. Following is information taken from 
the library documentation.<p>

     This computer software library is a collection of more than
400 high quality mathematical routines for scientific and
engineering applications.   All are written entirely in C
language.  Many of the functions are supplied in six different
arithmetic precisions: 32 bit single (24-bit significand), 64 bit
IEEE double (53-bit), 64 bit DEC (56-bit), 80 or 96 bit IEEE long
double (64-bit), and extended precision formats having 144-bit
and 336-bit significands.  The extended precision arithmetic is
included with the function library.<p>

     The library treats about 180 different mathematical
functions.  In addition to the elementary arithmetic and
transcendental routines, the library includes a substantial
collection of probability integrals, Bessel functions, and higher
transcendental functions.<p>

     There are complex variable routines covering complex
arithmetic, complex logarithm and exponential, and complex
trigonometric functions.<p>

     Each function subroutine has been tested by comparing at a
large number of points against high precision check routines. 
The test programs use floating point arithmetic having 144 bit
(43 decimal) precision.  Thus the actual accuracy of each program
is reported, not merely the result of a consistency test.  Test
results are given with the description of each routine.<p>

     The routines have been characterized and tested in IEEE Std
754 double precision arithmetic (both Intel and Motorola
formats), used on IBM PC and a growing number of other computers,
and also in the popular DEC/IBM double precision format.<p>

     For DEC and IEEE arithmetic, numerical constants and
approximation coefficients are supplied as integer arrays in
order to eliminate conversion errors that might be introduced by
the language compiler.  All coefficients are also supplied in the
normal decimal scientific notation so that the routines can be
compiled and used on other machines that do not support either of
the above numeric formats.<p>

     A single, common error handling routine is supplied.  Error
conditions produce a display of the function name and error type.
The user may easily insert modifications to implement any desired
action on specified types of error.<p>

     The following table summarizes the current contents of the
double precision library.  See also the corresponding
documentation for the single and long double precision libraries.
Accuracies reported for DEC and IEEE arithmetic are with
arithmetic rounding precision limited to 56 and 53 bits,
respectively.  Higher precision may be realized if an arithmetic
unit such as the 8087 or 68881 is used in conjunction with an
optimizing compiler.  The accuracy figures are experimentally
measured; they are not guaranteed maximum errors.<p>

    Documentation is included on the distribution media as
Unix-style manual pages that describe the functions and their
invocation.  The primary documentation for the library functions
is the book by Moshier, Methods and Programs for Mathematical
Functions, Prentice-Hall, 1989.
